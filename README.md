# JMeter Performance Testing – DummyJSON API

This project contains a JMeter test plan created to perform performance and load testing on the **DummyJSON** API (https://dummyjson.com).  
The test simulates multiple virtual users sending requests to various API endpoints to measure response time, throughput, and server behavior.
